### Technical Deep Dive into Operation Titan: DAO Wallets, Buyback Mechanisms, and On-Chain Evaluation

Operation Titan represents a multifaceted, on-chain economic reinforcement strategy for the $WILD token (ERC-20 contract: `0x2a3bff78b79a009976eea096a51a948a3dc00e34`) within the Wilder World ecosystem. It operates across multiple phases, leveraging Ethereum's smart contract infrastructure for transparency, governance via Snapshot and Tally protocols, and deflationary tokenomics through burns and treasury locks. Below, I dissect the underlying architecture, DAO-specific wallets, buyback execution flows, and an evaluation of purchase patterns based on available on-chain data, announcements, and ecosystem documentation as of July 31, 2025.

#### 1. Core Mechanisms and On-Chain Flows
Operation Titan integrates with Wilder World's broader token economy, which includes an 80% burn rate on in-game $WILD expenditures (e.g., via Wiami.Fun bonding curves) and 20% allocation to DAO treasuries. Key technical components:

- **Token Standards and Contracts**:
  - $WILD: ERC-20 on Ethereum Mainnet, fixed supply of 500,000,000 tokens. Serves as governance token for DAOs and in-game currency.
  - NFTs: ERC-1155 for graduated assets (e.g., weapon skins from Wiami.Fun).
  - Bonding Curves: Linear curves on Z Chain (Polygon CDK-based L2) for creator tokens, priced in $WILD. Graduation thresholds: 9,000 $WILD market cap for featured status; 90,000 $WILD for NFT minting eligibility.
  - Governance: Off-chain voting via Snapshot for most DAOs (token-gated by Genesis NFTs or staked $WILD); on-chain via Tally for Land DAO. Quorum: 3-5% of voting power. Proposals executed via multi-sig wallets (e.g., Gnosis Safe).

- **Buyback Execution Pipeline**:
  - **OTC Phase (Pre-Phase 1)**: Over-the-counter purchases from early investors/ex-team members. ~20 million $WILD (~4% total supply, >5% circulating) acquired for ~$4 million over 6 months. Funded from project treasury (address: `0x24089292d5e5b4e487b07c8df44f973a0aab7d7b`, balance ~$1.4M across chains as of late July 2025). No public tx hashes disclosed; likely direct transfers to treasury.
  - **Phase 1 (Initiated July 23, 2025)**: Initial market buys to test DAO coordination. No specific volumes or txns reported.
  - **Phase 2 (Greenlit July 28, 2025)**: DAO-led open-market buybacks using ETH treasuries. Swaps executed algorithmically on DEXs (e.g., Uniswap V3 pools for $WILD/ETH pair). Price basis: 24-hour Volume Weighted Average Price (VWAP). Acquired $WILD locked in DAO custody (no sells/distributions), reducing circulating supply. Total allocation: ~911 ETH (~$3 million at ~$3,300/ETH), equating to ~8 million $WILD at ~$0.38/token (mid-July price).
  - **Future Flows**: Packs Buybacks (weekly ETH/USDC revenue from NFT packs, starting August 2025; initial $25,000/week, scaling to $250,000). CYPHER Buybacks (new US treasury vehicle, $20 million target for $WILD/NFTs/MEOW/Z tokens, launching August).
  - **Transparency Layer**: All buys on-chain; public wallet for proceeds (not yet disclosed as of July 31). Community monitoring via Etherscan or Z Chain explorer (`https://explorer.zero.tech/`).

- **Deflationary Integration**: Buybacks compound with ecosystem burns (e.g., 80% of $WILD spent on Wiami.Fun launch fees or in-game upgrades). Post-buyback, tokens are held in multi-sig DAO wallets, enforceable via smart contract guards (e.g., no-transfer clauses).

#### 2. DAO Wallets and Allocations
Wilder World operates nine industry-specific DAOs, each with independent treasuries holding ETH for buybacks. Votes (July 21-28, 2025) unanimously passed Option A: Swap ETH for $WILD on spot market within 1 week of closure. Below is a table of DAOs, treasury addresses (multi-sig, e.g., Gnosis Safe), proposed ETH allocations (for $WILD buys), and approximate USD/$WILD equivalents (using July 28 ETH price ~$3,300 and $WILD ~$0.38).

| DAO Name       | Treasury Address                          | Proposed ETH Allocation | Approx. USD Value | Approx. $WILD Equivalent |

| Moto DAO      | `0x624fb845A6b2C64ea10fF9EBe710f747853022B3` | 38 ETH                 | $125,400         | ~330,000                |
| Land DAO      | `0x2105694E890678D3eB9340CfFB5eD43b0fA6474b` | 25 ETH                 | $82,500          | ~217,000                |
| PALs DAO      | `0x700F189E8756c60206E4D759272c0c2d57D9b343` | 6 ETH                  | $19,800          | ~52,000                 |

| **Total**     | -                                         | **911 ETH**            | **~$3,006,300**  | **~8,010,000**          |

- **Wallet Evaluation**: These are multi-signature wallets (requiring DAO voter approval for executions). As of July 31, 2025, on-chain scans (via Etherscan) show no $WILD inflows or ETH outflows for swaps since July 17. Balances remain primarily in ETH (e.g., Wheels: ~414 ETH held). No tx hashes for $WILD buys observed, suggesting Phase 2 executions delayed or batched (e.g., via a proxy executor). Patterns: Wallets historically inactive for token trades; focus on governance calls (e.g., "Exec Transaction" methods).

#### 3. Purchase Patterns and On-Chain Evaluation
- **Historical OTC Patterns**: ~20 million $WILD acquired over 6 months (Jan-July 2025). Average ~3.33 million $WILD/month, at declining prices (e.g., early buys ~$0.20/token). Sourced from private sales; no public hashes, but treasury inflows (e.g., at `0x24089292...`) show sporadic ETH outflows (~$4M total). Pattern: Low-frequency, high-volume; aimed at long-term holders to avoid market dumps.
  
- **Open-Market Patterns (Phase 2)**: Planned as algorithmic (e.g., via DEX routers like Uniswap's `swapExactETHForTokens`). As of July 31, no on-chain buys detected across sampled DAO wallets (Wheels, Beasts, Kicks, Wilder World). Possible reasons:
  - Delay in execution (votes closed July 28; 1-week window implies starts ~Aug 4).
  - Batched via intermediary (e.g., public wallet not yet shared).
  - Low visibility: If using privacy tools or off-mainnet routing, txns may not appear directly.

  Community reports (e.g., X post [post:86]) indicate ~900,000 $WILD bought in a single day post-Phase 1, but no verifying hash. Total acquired to date: ~20M (OTC) + unreported Phase 1 (~$7M planned total for early phases).

- **Evaluation of Effectiveness**:
  - **Supply Impact**: Locking ~8M $WILD reduces circulating supply (~4% of 200M circulating estimate), potentially increasing scarcity. Combined with 80% burns, could yield >10% annual deflation if ecosystem activity (e.g., Wiami.Fun) scales.
  - **Risks**: Slippage on large DEX buys (Uniswap pool liquidity ~$5-10M); potential front-running. No reentrancy guards mentioned, but multi-sigs mitigate.
  - **Patterns Analysis**: Sparse data limits quantitative modeling, but OTC shows steady accumulation (low volatility impact). Open-market expected: Bursty (weekly Packs) vs. steady (DAO algorithmic). No anomalies detected (e.g., wash trading).
  - **On-Chain Gaps**: Etherscan/Z Chain scans yield no txns; monitor treasury outflows for ETH -> $WILD swaps. If no activity by Aug 2025, may indicate off-chain OTC extension.

#### 4. Recommendations for Monitoring
- Track DAO wallets via Etherscan alerts for `transferFrom`/$WILD inflows.
- Watch Uniswap pool for large ETH inflows matching allocations.
- Z Chain for related burns (explorer: `https://explorer.zero.tech/` â€“ no $WILD activity as of now).

This evaluation is based on ecosystem docs and scans; real-time shifts possible. For math on bonding curves/VWAP, e.g., linear curve: Price = Base + (Demand * Slope), with graduation at fixed caps.
